Logistic Regression - Telecom Churn Case Study
Project Overview
This project involves the application of Logistic Regression to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. The objective is to identify key factors that lead to customer churn and use a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

Problem Statement
In the competitive telecom industry, customer retention is crucial. This project focuses on building a predictive model to classify customers based on their likelihood of churning, which will help the company take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

Approach
Data Understanding:

A detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the characteristics of the data.
Missing values, outliers, and categorical variables are handled appropriately before model building.
Data Preparation:

Features are engineered, including normalization and encoding of categorical variables to prepare the data for model building.
Modeling:

Logistic regression is used as the primary classification algorithm for this project.
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Results and Insights:

Insights into the most important features contributing to churn are derived and discussed.
Recommendations are made based on the model outcomes to improve customer retention strategies.
Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries of the data.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, outlier detection, feature scaling, and encoding.
Logistic Regression Model: Implementation of a classification model to predict customer churn.
Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation using confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve.
Insights and Recommendations: Based on the findings, suggestions are provided to reduce churn.
Dependencies
The following libraries and tools are required to run the project:

Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
